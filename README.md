How do we detect shill bidders in online auctions? 

Shill bidding is a fraudulent practice in online auctions where individuals knowingly or unknowingly collude with sellers to artificially inflate the price of an item. This is achieved through behaviors such as placing low initial bids to lure genuine participants, repeatedly increasing their own bids despite holding the highest bid, and abstaining from bidding at the auction's close to avoid winning.

This practice harms auction platforms, buyers, and legitimate sellers by eroding trust, increasing costs, and enabling criminal activity. Consequently, an effective detection system is essential to maintain the integrity of online auctions. An algorithm capable of detecting and flagging fraudulent bids could significantly reduce criminal revenues while protecting the interests of honest users. <br>

I propose training a machine learning (ML) algorithm to classify bids as either fraudulent (shill) or legitimate. By automating this detection process, platforms can identify suspicious activity in real-time or retrospectively. This would allow for preventive measures such as disallowing fraudulent bids or taking corrective actions, such as flagging or banning accounts involved in shill bidding.
